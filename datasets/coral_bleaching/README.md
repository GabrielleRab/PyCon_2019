### Coral Bleaching:
These datasets summarize coral reef station data from the [NOAA Coral Reef Watch](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/vs/). The NOAA Coral Reef Watch program uses satellite data to provide current reef environmental conditions to quickly identify areas at risk for coral bleaching. Bleaching is the process by which corals lose the symbiotic algae that give them their distinctive colors. If a coral is severely bleached, disease and death become likely.

There are six included datasets for six of the NOAA coral reef stations in Fiji, the Florida Keys, the Galapagos, the Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii, and Palau. The columns are defined as follows:
* Date of data collection
* Latitude of station
* Longitude of station
* Sea Surface Temperature (in Celsius)
* Hot Spots (magnitude of instantaneous heat stress, potentially resulting in coral bleaching. The scale ranges from 0 to 5 °C. HotSpot values of 1 °C or more indicate heat stress leading to coral bleaching)
* Degree Heating Weeks (accumulated bleaching heat stress over a 12 week period. The scale ranges from 0 to 20 °C-weeks. Significant coral bleaching usually occurs when the DHW value reaches 4 °C-weeks. At 8 °C-weeks, widespread bleaching is likely and significant mortality can be expected.)
* Bleaching Alert Area (measure of coral bleaching thermal stress as follows: 0-no stress, 1-bleaching watch, 2-bleaching warning, 3-bleaching alert lvl 1, 4-bleaching alert lvl 2)
