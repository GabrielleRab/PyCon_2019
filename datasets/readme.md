# PyCon 2019 datasets
Datasets for PyCon 2019 Education Summit Mini-Sprint: Workbooks that teach Python through scientific data exploration

All datasets in this directory are publically available and sourced from primary research articles or government databases. A description of each data collection can be found below:

### Plant Archaeology:
These datasets compile, from published sources, the sample records of archaeobotanical (plant) remains from archaeological sites located in southwest Asia, central Anatolia and Cyprus dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic or earlier. These datasets were downloaded from the UK Archaeology Data Service, the [Origins of agriculture: archaeobotanical database](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/origins_nerc_2018/index.cfm).

The data was collected by Michael Wallace, Alexandra Livarda, Michael Charles, and Glynis Jones, from the Universities of Sheffield, Nottingham, and Oxford. The research article explaining their findings is entitled "Re-analysis of archaeobotanical remains from pre- and early agricultural sites provides no evidence for a narrowing of the wild plant food spectrum during the origins of agriculture in southwest Asia" and can be read in its entirety [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00334-018-0702-y).

The four included datasets are as follows:
* plant_metadata.csv: Definitions for all column headers
* plant_site_names.csv: Location information for each archaeological site in the study
* plant_samples.csv: Details of individual samples
* plant_taxa.csv: Summary data for each plant taxa recorded
