# PyCon_2019
Repository for PyCon 2019 Education Summit Mini-Sprint: Workbooks that teach Python through scientific data exploration. Facilitated by Gabrielle Rabinowitz.

Participants in this mini-sprint will create educational resources that help high school students master coding concepts in Python while exploring real scientific datasets and proposing answers to big questions. We will use Jupyter Notebook, the pandas library, and publicly available data to create interactive workbooks that science and CS teachers can use in the classroom.
