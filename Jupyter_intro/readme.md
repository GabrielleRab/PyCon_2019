### What is Jupyter Notebook?
[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/about) is a non-profit, open-source project, born out of the IPython Project in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages.

[The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

### Installing Jupyter
The easiest way to install Jupyter Notebook on your computer if you do not already have it is to download [Anaconda-Navigator](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator). Jupyter is included in this installation.

Alternatively, you can install it using pip according to the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
